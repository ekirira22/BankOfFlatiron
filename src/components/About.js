                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>
                    Flatiron Bank was founded in 2023 by a team of entrepreneurs who were frustrated with the traditional banking system. They wanted a bank that was more responsive, innovative, and customer-centric. They also wanted a bank that leveraged the power of technology to provide better products and services.                    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    They decided to build their own bank from scratch, using the latest cloud-based infrastructure, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology. They named it Flatiron Bank, after the iconic building in New York City that symbolizes innovation and ambition.
